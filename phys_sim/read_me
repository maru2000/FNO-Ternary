Steps:

1. Input Params- 
 
 nx "xx" (x resolution)
 ny "yy" (y resolution)
 num_steps "" (Total number of steps needed)
 print_steps "" (Number of steps to print from first to last step - for step size)
 alloycomp_b "" (Initial composition of b phase)
 alloycomp_c "" (Initial composition of c phase)
 
 these are the parameters to change
 
2. PostProc.in -
 
 nx "xx"
 ny "yy"
 start ""
 steps "" (take from print_steps)
 finish ""
 
 set according to the values in InputParams
 
3. automate.sh - 
 
 var = 1111 (random seed for generating data)
 ind = 0 (number of batches)
 
 change 'ind' according to number of batches needed for the complete dataset in the line
 while [ $ind -le 'ind']
 
run the following command:
bash ./automate.sh

this will generate the data images in binary file format

use the python code in process_2.py to create a ''.npy file for the required dataset to use for
the model and prediction


4. process_2.py
 
 change values in range:
 ex if image size generated in (64,64)
 for j in range(64):
 "
 for j in range(65, 129):
 "
